# Python Reading

## John Zajac

### Chapter 1 "The Way of the Program" Notes

#### I knew  a lot of the value types, arithmetic functions and such since I have a somewhat decent background with Python. However I designed a calculator using C last year but didn't recreate it when I began learning Python. Because I didn't rebuild it or translate all the same functions from C to Python I didn't know about using ** as an exponential function. It's interesting because when building the calculator in C, implementing the exponential function was somewhat difficult and took a lot of work arounds to get to function.

### Chapter 3 "Functions" Notes

#### A lot of the information in this chapter was pretty refreshing having known a decent amoun tof it. Most if not all of the functions I was familiar with but it was good to get a refresher. I have used arguments in Python before but have used it significantly more in C rather than Python.

### Chapter 5 "Conditionals and Recursion" Notes

#### I knew all of the types of data structures discussed in the chapter but found it very helpful the focus on recursion. I feel like a lot of my codes and projects I create don't lean on recursion nearly as much as they should and find myself rebuilding my program at the end once I finish to reimplement and simplify to focus more on the recursion.
