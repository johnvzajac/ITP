## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

John Zajac's Portfolio

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

As I near college graduation, I find many applications requiring portfolios. Despite technically having one via linktree, I can't help but feel very unprofessional when submitting a link tree link as a "portfolio", therefore I hope to create a portfolio website to show off my work instead.

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

When I first began using HTML, JavaScript and CSS I relied heavily on resources such as javascript.com, MDN Web Docs, and W3C

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I want my project to be a simple yet in depth example of my timeline of work as an audio engineer and other career paths I may have worked. I would like for it to be straight forward and simple as can be as well as being in depth. I want to have audio and video playback for examples as well as maybe a way to download certain media such as a resume.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I want a better portfolio than what I currently have and I believe having the fact that I can show what I do with HTML, CSS, etc. will enhance that

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I get a job because of this website portfolio, because holy shit it's so hard to get a real job.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Finish the website absolutely, I feel like a lot of it is doable but I can easily see myself going on to bite off more than I can chew

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

This week I would like to begin maybe the layout and how I want the website to be structured
Next week I want to begin the basic text insertion without worrying about including any audio, video or other files
The week after I would like to finalize any of the audio, video, etc. and include some basic CSS and JavaScript
