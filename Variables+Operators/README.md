## I am not sure if I'm submitting this file too early since we had some classes moved around / cancelled because of the snow day and presidents day. Anyways I started this assignment having a decent idea in which direction to go when creating this print function. I knew it would require the usage of \n as well as \t throughout to create the shape of the text when displayed. My biggest issue I guess was creating the calculation so I would be able to print it within the function. I decided to create a variable called "value" before the print function and assigned it the sum of 1 and 2. I then converted value (which would be an integer variable) to a string by using the str() function. In the end I just had to tinker with how many \n and \t I used before each of the lines and I was eventually at the conclusion after about 2 renditions of the print function.
