# Phase 3 Documentation:

## Phase 3 tricked me up having to manually put in the variables to test but this was a whole new level. I believe since the if loops count how many times the columns and rows are used it should resize the grid from the original 400 x 400 to 40 x 40. This was very difficult to do as I was somewhat left to my imagination to solve this problem. I strongly believe that this is one of the solutions I came up to that can easily be broken and is not the strongest solution. However I do believe that by manually counting the height and width and dividing those values by 40 and then counting the remaining amount of x and y cells, I came close to the final result. I believe the grid division should scale with the object, from my testing it seems to scale the design down to the proper ratio however I am not certain that it keeps the original outline of the window in the previous phases. Despite these hiccups I believe these phases are built into the most solid original version of this design.
