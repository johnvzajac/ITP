## I wasn't really too sure on what shape to construct for the midterm exam and balanced a lot of different options when presented with the prompt. Recently I have been playing a decent amount of Dark Souls and Elden Ring and find myself gravitating towards the weapon called the "zweihander". Therefore I decided to design my project after the zweihander from the series constructing a sword equipped with a handle as well as some weird somewhat extra daggers or blades on the side. I think the sword is somewhat simple to construct being made comprised of mainly of 2 rectangles, 3 triangles and 1 square angled 45 degrees off center. While simple, it vaguely represents the look of the zweihander from the game and I'm decently happy with the design and believe I'm at the point where it is simple enough to where it is achievable as well as recognizable.
