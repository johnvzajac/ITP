# Phase 2 Documentation:

## I began the processing portion of the project sort of lost without much direction on what to do first and slowly began just putting in random numbers when the shapes were slightly not aligning. I picked through and slowly tried to align the shapes as much as I possibly could until I was able to eyeball it and was content with it. Surprisingly the hardest part was aligning the handle with the blade by even splitting the blade 50% on one side and another side but it's not perfect and I have to accept that as it's as close I could get it without getting down to the nitty gritty.
