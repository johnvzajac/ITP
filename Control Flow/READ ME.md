# Pyramid and Fizz Bizz

## John Zajac

### Pyramid

#### I've done lots of assignments when learning how to code creating pyramids made of #'s. I've always somewhat struggled with this concept having to print either #'s or " " depending on the user input. This time however I was able to put together the entire code within under 3 minutes. I decided to try to compile the entire code as much as I can and simplify it only down to it's bare necessities and think I simplified it as much as I possibly can apart from maybe converting the string value to the integer value.

### Fizz Bizz

#### At first I was a little confused on what to do completely forgetting about the remainder operation so I tried to somehow create the code with the division operation. But after about a minute I remembered the remainder operation and quickly rebuilt the code to have the value of i be either fully divisible by 3 or 5. The entire code took about 2 minutes and only tripped up regarding the remainder operation.
