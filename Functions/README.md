## I was very very confused when approaching this issue not really fully knowing how I could be able to print the graph similarly to last weeks assignment. I spent a good amount of time trying to figure out where the for loop should go. I quickly realized I misunderstood the directions since I originally thought there were the print_graph function, get power function and the actual executable code would have used the for loop there rather than what I used which was making the print_graph function use the for loop. After that I believed I was done after but instead realized that the could was still too complicated, by using the variable i in the for loop I realized there was no actual value assigned to the x. After realizing I replaced the x variables with the i variable therefore assigning an actual real value to that variable. After that I then realized another issue when the graph was displayed it would be incorrect since the code accepts negative values within the get_power function. After that I think this is the completed and finalized code to display y=x^2. I'm not confident with this being 100% correct but believe this is the relative path for the correct code to display the graph
